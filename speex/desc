# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

speex:
speex: The Speex project aims to build an open-source patent-free voice
speex: codec.  Unlike other codecs like MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, Speex is
speex: specially designed for compressing voice at low bit-rates for 
speex: applications such as voice over IP (VoIP).  In some sense, it is
speex: meant to be complementary to the Ogg-Vorbis codec.
