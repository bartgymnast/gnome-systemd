# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

ragel: ragel (State Machine Compiler)
ragel:
ragel: Ragel is a software development tool that allows user actions to be 
ragel: embedded into the transitions of a regular expression's corresponding
ragel: state machine, eliminating the need to switch from the regular
ragel: expression engine and user code execution environment and back again.
ragel: As a result, expressions can be maximally continuous. Ragel compiles
ragel: executable finite state machines from a high level regular language
ragel: notation. Ragel targets C, C++, Objective-C, D, Go, Java and Ruby.
