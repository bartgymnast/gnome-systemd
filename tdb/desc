# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

tdb: tdb (a simple database API)
tdb:
tdb: This is a simple database API. It was inspired by the realisation
tdb: that in Samba we have several ad-hoc bits of code that essentially
tdb: implement small databases for sharing structures between parts of
tdb: Samba.
tdb:
tdb: The interface is based on gdbm. gdbm couldn't be use as we needed to
tdb: be able to have multiple writers to the databases at one time.
