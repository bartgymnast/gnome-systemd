	2.34.0-2dl:
	* Bumped build number to 2dl. 
	* Added PKG_SANIFYNOTOUCH to prevent running autoconf after configure.
	* We need a 2 round build if we want to build the tests, firstl
	without makecheck, later by installing glib2 and rebuilding it over
	with makecheck.

2012-10-04 Eugene Wissner <belka.ew@gmail.com>
	* Updated to 2.34.0

2012-06-05 Eugene Wissner <belka.ew@gmail.com>
	* Added ChangeLog
	* Updated to 2.32.3 needed for GNOME 3.4.1
	* Added patch to remove one test from "make check". It seems to be a bug
	because I tried to compile glib2 in openSUSE with the same result. C
	function returns a wrong value
	* doinst.sh, libglib2.sh, and libglib2.csh copied from the last Slackware
	* libglib2.sh.new and libglib2.csh.new created in doinst.sh instead of
	build (configfile() does it)
	* PKG_DOCDIR changed to /usr/doc/glib-$VERSION (Slackware style)
	* Set executable bit for /etc/* (shell scripts) and owner root:root for
	profile.d
