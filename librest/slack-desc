# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

librest: rest (library designed to access RESTful based web services easier)
librest:
librest: This library has been designed to make it easier to access web
librest: services that claim to be "RESTful". A reasonable definition of what
librest: this means can be found on Wikipedia [1]. However a reasonable
librest: description is that a RESTful service should have urls that represent
librest: remote objects which methods can then be called on.
