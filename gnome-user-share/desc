# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

gnome-user-share: gnome-user-share is a small package that binds together various free
gnome-user-share: software projects to bring easy to use user-level file sharing to the

gnome-user-share:
gnome-user-share: The program is meant to run in the background when the user is logged
gnome-user-share: in, and when file sharing is enabled a webdav server is started that
gnome-user-share: shares the $HOME/Public folder. The share is then published to all
gnome-user-share: computers on the local network using mDNS/bonjour, so that it shows
gnome-user-share: up in the Network location in Gnome.
