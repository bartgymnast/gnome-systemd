# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

portaudio:
portaudio: PortAudio is a portable audio I/O library designed for cross-platform
portaudio: support of audio. It uses either a callback mechanism to request audio
portaudio: processing, or blocking read/write calls to buffer data between the 
portaudio: native audio subsystem and the client. Audio can be processed in
portaudio: various formats, including 32 bit floating point, and will be
portaudio: converted to the native format internally.
