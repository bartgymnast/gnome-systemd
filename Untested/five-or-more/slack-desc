# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

five-or-more: Five or More (the port of the once popular Windows game Color Lines)
five-or-more:
five-or-more: Five or More is a deceptively simple brain workout. The goal is to
five-or-more: place at least five objects of the same color or shape</link> into a
five-or-more: straight line. The line can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.  Once
five-or-more: five or more objects are grouped into a line, they disappear. The goal
five-or-more: is to vanish as many objects as possible.  The game is over when the
five-or-more: entire board is full.
